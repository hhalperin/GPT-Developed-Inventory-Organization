## ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### If Changes Need Reverting
1. **Configuration**: Revert to monolith constants if environment issues
2. **Data Management**: Fallback to monolith functions if class issues
3. **API Integration**: Use monolith API calls if GPTClient fails
4. **Classification**: Revert to monolith MLCategorizer if model issues
5. **Pipeline**: Use monolith main execution if orchestration fails

### Backup Strategy
- Keep `monolith.py` intact as reference and fallback
- Document all major changes for easy reversal
- Test each change incrementally before proceeding
- Maintain compatibility with existing data formats
